    "We \"walked\" from simple direct inversion to more and more principled Bayesian inverse models. We saw that the Bayesian inverse model is more robust to noise and uncertainty, but also more computationally expensive and it is harder to take advantage of things we often have in abundance: *data* and *deep learning approaches*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can *combine* some of the benefits of a Bayesian and the traditional ML approach. There are several ways to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using ML to learn a *fast approximate forward model* (neural emulation), where we amortise the cost of simulation in the Bayesian model by using a learned model. \n",
    "2. Using ML to learn a latent representation of sensor states (either unsupervised, or as a byproduct from a supervised direct inverse model), and then perform Bayesian inference in this space. For example, we can reduce a camera stream to a small vector of features that are more robust to noise and easier to model.\n",
    "3. Incorporating direct inverse model outputs as evidence sources in a Bayesian inverse model. In this case, we run a direct model first, and then use the output as *part* of the evidence in a Bayesian model. This can be useful when the direct model is fast and accurate, but not robust to noise or uncertainty.\n",
    "4. Use a slow but accurate Bayesian inverse model to *train* a better direct inverse model. This can be done as *active learning* where the Bayesian model is used to generate *good* training data for the inverse model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning a latent representation\n",
    "One way to combine these ideas is to train a neural network to learn a latent representation of the sensor data. This can be done in a supervised way (as we have seen), with some bottleneck layer that forces a simple latent representation, or in a fully unsupervised way (for example, using variational autoencoders). In either case, we learn a much simpler latent space that captures (hopefully) salient elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can then apply simulation to generate synthetic observations, put them through the learned latent representation, and then perform likelihood-based inference in this space. This can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the input space, and to make the data more robust to noise.\n",

    "## Fusing a direct inverse\n",
    "Another way to combine these ideas is to use a direct inverse model as part of the evidence update in a Bayesian model. This can be useful when the direct model is fast and accurate, but not robust to noise or uncertainty. In this case, we run the direct model first, and then use the output as part of the evidence in a Bayesian model. This can be seen as a way to \"smooth\" the output of the direct model, and to make it more robust to noise and uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we can make some uncertainty quantification on the direct inverse model (there are various ways we could do this), we can then automatically handover between the direct and Bayesian models depending on the confidence of the direct model. This can be seen as a way to make the direct model adaptively robust to noise and uncertainty. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the direct model might be used in regimes where there is lots of training data, and the Bayesian model be more heavily weighted in regimes where there is less data and first-principles modelling is more relevant.\n",
