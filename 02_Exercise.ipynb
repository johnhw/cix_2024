    "* I can run the keyboard model, but it doesn't connect to the machine learning!\n",
    "    * This is probably a firewall issue on your laptop. You need to allow port 5556 for localhost traffic.\n",
    "* The predictions are too good even with a simple model!\n",
    "    * Make sure you are making the problem hard enough -- see the model variations below!\n",
    "* The predictions are bad!\n",
    "    * Yes, the default settings are not especially optimal. Also, these are simplified models to not make your life too complicated.\n",
    "* I don't have a group.\n",
